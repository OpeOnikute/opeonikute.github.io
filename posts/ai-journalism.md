I came into the tech industry in Nigeria at a fortunate time. There was a very strong sense of community, with a lot of early-phase builders working together. My fortune was not just because those builders existed though -- it was because platforms like TechCabal told their stories so we could learn about them.

*TODO* - create the conflict - why I had the idea.

Almost 10 years ago, I had an idea for a tool to generate stories for journalists based on strictly-defined prompts [^1]. After answering a couple of questions, the users would get a long-form story they could tweak at will. If that sounds familiar, it's because that has turned out to be Generative AI. 

A usable solution was not in my skillset at the time and the technology wasn't there. I also obviously had no way of knowing that it would manifest in this way, but it has been interesting to see technology finally catch up to a version of my vision. 

Also, nobody reached out:
> Hopefully i’ll be able to revisit this later in some machine-learning capacity. If you’re reading this and have ideas on how this could work, please reach out.

## *Insert title of next section*
The fundamental premise was wrong though. Nowadays I don't believe we should be aiming to have machines generate our stories.
