I came into the tech industry in Nigeria at a fortunate time. There was a very strong sense of community, with a lot of early-phase builders working together. My fortune was not just because those builders existed though -- it was because platforms like TechCabal told their stories so we could learn about them.

*TODO* - create the conflict - why I had the idea.

Almost 10 years ago, I had an idea for a tool to generate stories for journalists based on strictly-defined prompts [^1]. After answering a couple of questions, the users would get a long-form story they could tweak at will. If that sounds familiar, it's because that has turned out to be Generative AI. 

A usable solution was not in my skillset at the time and the technology wasn't there. I also obviously had no way of knowing that it would manifest in this way, but it has been interesting to see technology finally catch up to a version of my vision. 

Also, nobody reached out:
> Hopefully i’ll be able to revisit this later in some machine-learning capacity. If you’re reading this and have ideas on how this could work, please reach out.

## *Insert title of next section*
Nowadays, I don't believe we should aim to have machines generate our stories. Journalism is about much more than generating content, and Large-Language Models (LLMs) cannot be fully trusted with both real-time and historical facts. BBC research found that major AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini produced significant inaccuracies in over half of the news summaries that they tested [^2].

It should not be surprising that I now think the best use of such a tool would be as an assistant for research, fact-checking, and ideation. LLMs should not replace our fundamental ability to reason and create.

In the rest of this post, I'll discuss LLMs in the context of journalism. How can we use AI to write better stories in the real world?

### Training a Model

**The title here is a bit misleading.
Maybe not? You don't need to train the model because all you need is the exta context.
So a simple paragraph about choosing the right model will suffice.**

#### *Insert title about RAG*


#### *Title about MCP*
- Also add a simple MCP server demo for a news site?
    - Another open-source project to spam
- 

### Research question: how do you design an in-house information system to ensure news accuracy?

#### Real-time streaming

#### Human in-the-loop

#### Guardrails

### Auto-RAG

### Bonus: RAG demo (my website)
* Will need an open-source model so people can test 
* Or should I use Auto-RAG to promote Cloudflare and somehow embed it into the post?
